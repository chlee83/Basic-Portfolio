                    If I had to describe myself in one word it would be <em>curious</em>. 
                    When I was younger and to this very day, I have always had too many interests &ndash; too many things I wanted to learn and do.
                    Growing up, I was into photography, video editing, and learning different musical instruments. 
                    During college years, I learned how to develop websites using html, css, and flash 
                    <span style="font-size: 14px; font-style: oblique;">(is that even used anymore?)</span>, 
                    which actually had nothing to do with my major.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was younger I think I didn't really know how to focus all those interests so I was a bit all over the place. 
                    Thankfully, after graduating from Rutgers, I thought more about my life and career path.
                    That's when I got into the education field and have been doing that ever since.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    Currently, I run and teach at a tutoring center that a friend and I started in 2012.
                    It's called <strong>GO Learning Center</strong>. GO is an acronym for <strong>G</strong>rowth and <strong>O</strong>pportunities.
                    This learning center was my chance to teach the way I wanted and how I wanted.
                    We decided on our motto of growth and opportunities because that's exactly what we wanted to provide for the students.
                    A place to learn, grow, and create more opportunities for their future. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with being an educator, I love to build/create things.
                    It can be furniture, videos, legos (aspiring master builder), snowmen, or websites.
                    I think this is why I had an interest in web development in the past and still have that interest now. 
                    Although I dabbled in web development years ago, I didn't fully realize the limitless
                    possibilities one could have if he or she knew all the tools and codes that are available these days.
                    So hopefully, through this course I can learn to build dynamic and creative websites.
